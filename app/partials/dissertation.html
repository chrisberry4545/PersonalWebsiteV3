                    As part of my MSc. in Computer Science I wrote a paper titled 'Using reinforcement learning to
                    find a winning strategy for Monopoly. I received a distinction for this paper.

            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>
                Machine Learning requires a large amount of processor power which initial held it back. As processors
                get more powerful it becomes a very feasible to use this technique to get computers to perform more
                complex decisions makings where many factors are at work.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">Reinforced Learning</a> (an
                area of Machine Learning) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Neural Network</a>
                to allow an Artificial Intelligence to become a good Monopoly player.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AI played many thousands of games against itself during which is tried to work out which moves are most likely to lead to success.

                <h2>Choice of technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    The project was programmed using Java. This was the language I was most comfortable with at the time and also the language which the neural network
                    I was provided with was written in. I used the GUI widget toolkit, Swing, for the display but the rest of the project could be completed using the
                    standard java libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used Java Web start to allow people to easily download the program and so I could get feedback on their experiences against the best AIs.

                <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge faced was doing everything I wanted to in the time limit. As the AI had to play so many games against itself, getting a single version
                    ready for testing would often take several days of running non-stop on my PC. I also ran some other versions using the amazon services. I worked very long hours
                    over the first few weeks so I could get the thing running correctly and well tested so I could start experimenting with different factors. When I started experimenting
                    I had to make sure I planned what I was going to try next based on the possible outcomes of my previous experiments so I didn't waste time changing things once one experiment had 
                    finished.
                </p>
                <p>
