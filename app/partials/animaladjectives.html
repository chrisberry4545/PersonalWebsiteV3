                    Animal Adjectives started life as a game I my friends and I used to play while on ski lifts in Canada. 
                    It's silly but good fun.

	                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
	                <p>
	                    The applications consists of two lists. A list of animal names and a list of adjectives. It chooses a random
	                    word from each and combines the two together. If you're connected to the net, it then uses a google image search to show 
	                    the first picture of the animal.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The core application is enhanced by features such as notifications (users are sent an regular Animal Adjectives), a favourites list and share to Facebook button.
	                </p>

	                <h2>Choice of technology</h2>
	                <p>
	                    I didn't need to look any further than the standard Android libraries for the majority of the application.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    As the adjectives and animals are just stored in a text file they are easy to change and it was simple
	                    to implement. Text files and images from google rather than storing them locally has kept the size
	                    of the application down.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    I used the Facebook API to allow users to share their favourite Animal Adjectives with their friends.

	                <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
	                <p>
	                    The biggest problem I've had so far was getting the Share to Facebook button working. Obstacles such as 
	                    getting test users set up and posting correctly took me longer than I expected them to.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    I also had some issues with notifications. It took me some time to get the hang of setting up a service.
	                    I found I spent much longer implementing these additional features rather than the core app itself.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The other problem I often find myself facing with Android is making the app look good on a variety of screen sizes. I
	                    have both a large tablet and smaller phone which made the task easier but it always seems quite fiddly. I find the process
	                    much easier with web technologies. Next, I intend to see if I can recreate the app using PhoneGap, which will also mean I can
	                    release it for other operating systems.
	                </p>
