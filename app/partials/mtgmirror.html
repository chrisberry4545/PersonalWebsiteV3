	                <p>
	                    My housemate got in me into MTG when he promised it was like a game I adored as a kid, Pokemon cards.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The more established websites provided ways to practice certain elements of the game like <a href="http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Booster_draft">drafting</a>.
	                    However, when new cards were released they were often very slow to update their websites. I believed this could achieved
	                    by creating an easily updated site.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The website gets alot of hits, especially around the release of a new expansion (35,000 in September 2014). The audience is from all over the world but the vast majority come from the US.
	                    The website feels faster than any of the other similiar sites as its processed via client side JavaScript.

	                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
	                <p>
	                    The application consists of 4 parts.
	                </p>
	                <h3>Draft Simulator</h3>
	                <p>
	                    In the draft simulator you play against 7 other AIs, taking it in turn to pick cards.
	                    The AI uses a fairly simple strategy for picking based on the rating of the cards
	                    and the 'colors' (teams) the cards belong to.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    When the all the cards are assigned a player are able to build a deck from them. The app uses <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">chartjs</a> to generate
	                    graphical analysis of the cards the player has included in their deck.
	                </p>
	                <h3>Sealed Simulator</h3>
	                <p>
	                    Another popular way of playing Magic is 'Sealed' play where each player opens a number of packs and tries to build a deck from the contents.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    Like the draft simulator my website provides graphical analysis of the cards picked and allows the user to download their selection as a text file so they can
	                    import their selection to other programs.
	                </p>
	                <h3>Other parts</h3>
	                <p>
	                    The site also features a booster simulator and a card browser which were mainly created through reusing code from the parts above.
	                </p>

	                <h2>Choice of technology</h2>
	                <p>
	                    The majority of the website is built using client side Javascript. This keeps the load on the server smaller and
	                    utilises the power of modern devices. I used <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. Much of the logic for
	                    opening packs etc was shared between the different views so using Angular allowed me to put all this logic into services
	                    which could be utilised by any of the views.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to make the website responsive. The site adapts nicely
	                    to whatever device you're viewing it on.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    I was also able to include some other sweet technologies like HTML5's Application Cache and File Saver.
	                </p>

	                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
	                <p>
	                    The biggest challenge faced was trying to get the website working as quickly as possible. I needed to show the card images
	                    for many cards at once and I new it would be a pain if each time a user opened a pack they had to wait for all these images
	                    to load.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The solution to this was to use HTML5's Application Cache. This meant I could download all the images from the latest set to the user's
	                    device as soon as they go to the website. Once this happens once the images never need to be loaded again (as long as the user doesn't
	                    clear the app data). There was another cool side effect of this - once all the data was cached the app is usuable whether you are online
	                    or not.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    My other challenge was trying reduce the clutter on the interface. 
	                    I have tried to hide more advanced options within toggles and kept non-essential buttons small while making frequently used buttons
	                    clear and large. This keeps it simple for the average user while allowing further customization for those who want it.
	                </p>
