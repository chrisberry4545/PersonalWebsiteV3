                <h1>MTG Mirror</h1>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://mtgmirror.com">
                        Have a peak at the website here.
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got into Magic in 2013 when a housemate promised me it was like Pokemon cards; a game I couldn't get enough of in primary school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more established websites provided ways to practice certain elements of the game such as <a href="http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Booster_draft">drafting</a>.
                    However, when new cards were released they were often slow to update their websites. I believed this could be done quite
                    easily so set about building a website that could be updated easily and provide this functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website gets alot of hits, especially around the release of a new expansion (35,000 in September 2014). The audience is from all over the world but the vast majority come from the US.
                    The website is much more responsive than any of the other similiar websites as its all done with client side Javascript.

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>
                    The application consists of 4 parts.
                </p>
                <h3>Draft Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                    In the draft simulator you play against 7 other AIs I designed, taking it in turn to pick cards.
                    The AI uses a fairly simple strategy for picking based on the rating of the cards
                    and the 'colors' (kind of like teams) the cards are part of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the all the cards are assigned a player are able to build a deck from them. The app uses <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">chartjs</a> to generate
                    graphical analysis of the cards the player has included in their deck.
                </p>
                <h3>Sealed Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                    Another popular way of playing Magic is 'Sealed' play where each player opens a number of packs and tries to build a deck from the contents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the draft simulator my website provides graphical analysis of the cards picked and allows the user to download their selection as a text file so they can
                    import their selection to other programs.
                </p>
                <h3>Booster Simulator and Card Browser</h3>
                <p>
                    I used technologies which allowed me to reuse most of my code so implementing these two features was so simple it would have been wrong not to. The booster simulator
                    lets people open a number of boosters and the card browser lets people browse all of the cards featured on the website.
                </p>

                <h2>Choice of technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the website is built using client side Javascript. This keeps the load on the server smaller and
                    utilises the power of modern devices. I used <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as it allowed me to
                    seperate fully seperate my logic from the HTML and gave me plenty of chances for code reuse. Much of the logic for
                    opening packs etc was shared between the different views so using Angular allowed me to put all this logic into services
                    which could be utilised by any of the views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to make the website entirely responsive. The site looks great
                    whatever device you view it on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also able to include some other sweet technologies like HTML5's Application Cache and File Saver.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge faced was trying to get the website working as quickly as possible. I needed to show the card images
                    for many cards at once and I new it would be a pain if each time a user opened a pack they had to wait for all these images
                    to load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution to this was to use HTML5's Application Cache. This meant I could download all the images from the latest set to the user's
                    device as soon as they go to the website. Once this happens once the images never need to be loaded again (as long as the user doesn't
                    clear the app data). There was another cool side effect of this. Once all the data was cached the app is usuable whether you are online
                    or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other challenge was trying to keep the interface to a minimum so it looks good on any device and doesn't overcomplicate the app.
                    I have tried to hide more advanced options within toggles and kept non-essential buttons small while making the most used buttons
                    clear and large. This means that if you want to fine tune the options you can but they won't detract from the experience of the
                    average user.
                </p>
