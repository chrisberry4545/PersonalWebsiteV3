                <p>
                    On this site I've showcased some of the projects I've worked on outside of the office.

                    This site is set up using my favourite client side JavaScript framework, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. the site is
                    a single page app which means although the initial load might take a bit longer, once it's there
                    the site feels much more responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap 3</a> so I could quickly set up a good looking and responsive site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I've used <a href="http://highslide.com/">Highslide</a> to provide image thumbnails and popup images.
