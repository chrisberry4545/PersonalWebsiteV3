                    My friends band wanted to release their latest E.P in a different manner. I wanted to try out some Android
                    development so I was happy to try and give it a go.

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>
                    The app presents a simple carousel interface for playing a track which fits with the feel of the band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few other tabs with the band's bio and links to their social media sites.

                <h2>Choice of technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the this was built with the native android technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was able to find an excellent carousel by Igor Kushnarev on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/146145/Android-D-Carousel">code project</a> which looks great in the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had to make use of Android's Media Players and Services to get the Music to keep playing even when the app was closed. These parts forced me to get a clear understanding of
                    an the Android Activity lifecycle which has been very useful.

                <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was keeping the music playing even when the App had closed. This required a ton of testing to get right but luckily I had the band to help me out with this.
                    Eventually I was able to get the music player set up in the proper way with a fixed notification showing when the app was playing. This could of been improved further by adding
                    media controls from the notifications screen but due to the time constraints (I had to finish before the band went live with their EP) I didn't get the time.
